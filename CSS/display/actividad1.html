            He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone 
            eighty-four days now without taking a fish.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish 
            the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, 
            which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat 
            which caught three good fish the first week.
        </p>
        <p>
            It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he 
            always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the 
            sail that was furled around the mast.
